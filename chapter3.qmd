# Chapter 3: Free Parental Control Tools

In the previous chapter, we discussed the importance of parental control and monitoring tools in keeping your kids safe online. But with so many options on the market, it can be hard to know where to start. In this chapter, we'll explore some of the best free parental control solutions available.

### Built-In Operating System Controls

One of the first places to look for parental controls is right on your children's devices. Most major operating systems, including Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android, have built-in features to help you manage your kids' online activities.

#### Windows 10 Family Safety

-   Comes pre-installed on all Windows 10 devices.
-   Allows you to create separate child accounts with custom restrictions.
-   Features include web filtering, app blocking, screen time limits, and activity reporting.
-   Can manage Xbox One gaming consoles as well.

#### Apple Screen Time

-   Built into iOS 12 and later, as well as macOS Catalina and later.
-   Lets you set app limits, content restrictions, and downtime schedules.
-   Provides detailed reports on your children's device usage.
-   Can be managed remotely from a parent device.

#### Google Family Link

-   A free app for Android and iOS devices.
-   Allows you to create supervised child accounts.
-   Offers app management, web filtering, location tracking, and usage limits.
-   Can be used to manage Chromebooks as well.

These built-in controls can be a great starting point for many families. They're easy to set up, don't require any additional software, and cover a wide range of devices. However, they may not offer as many features or customization options as some standalone programs.

### Kid-Safe Browsers

Another free option for younger children is a kid-safe browser. These are special web browsers designed specifically for kids, with built-in content filters and other safety features.

Some popular kid-safe browsers include:

-   **Kiddle:** A visual search engine for kids, with safe search results, large thumbnails, and simple navigation.
-   **Kidzui:** A standalone browser that only allows access to pre-approved, age-appropriate websites and videos.
-   **Maxthon Kid-Safe Browser:** A customizable browser with parental controls, content filtering, and usage monitoring.

Kid-safe browsers can be a good choice for young children who are just starting to explore the web. They provide a controlled environment with limited access to inappropriate content. However, they may be too restrictive for older kids who need to use the internet for school or socializing.

### OpenDNS FamilyShield

A third free option is OpenDNS FamilyShield. This is a DNS-based content filtering service that blocks access to adult websites and other inappropriate content at the network level.

Here's how it works:

1.  You change your router's DNS settings to use the FamilyShield DNS servers.
2.  Any device connected to your network will automatically have its web traffic filtered.
3.  You can customize the filter settings and view activity reports through the OpenDNS dashboard.

Some advantages of OpenDNS FamilyShield include:

-   It's completely free, with no subscription or registration required.
-   It works on any device connected to your home network.
-   It's easy to set up, with no software to install.

However, there are also some limitations:

-   It only filters web traffic, not apps or other internet activities.
-   It may not catch all inappropriate content, especially on non-English websites.
-   Tech-savvy kids may be able to bypass the filters by changing their device's DNS settings.

Despite these drawbacks, OpenDNS FamilyShield can be a useful addition to your family's online safety toolkit, especially when combined with other parental control methods.

### Case Study: The Patel Family

To see how these free tools can work in practice, let's look at the Patel family. Anika and Raj Patel have two children: Anya, age 8, and Rohan, age 13. They wanted to start using parental controls but weren't ready to invest in a paid program.

For Anya, they set up a kid-safe browser on her tablet. This gave her a safe space to explore the web, with only pre-approved, age-appropriate content. They also enabled the built-in screen time limits on her device to help manage her usage.

For Rohan, they used the Windows 10 Family Safety tools on his laptop. This allowed them to set content restrictions, app limits, and activity monitoring without installing any extra software. They also had a conversation with Rohan about the reasons for the new rules and gave him some input on the settings.

Finally, they set up OpenDNS FamilyShield on their home router. This provided an extra layer of protection against inappropriate websites for all devices on their network.

While these free tools didn't cover every aspect of online safety, they gave the Patels a solid foundation to build on. As their children grow and their needs change, they can look into more advanced paid options (which we'll cover in the next chapter).

### The Bottom Line

Free parental control tools can be a great way to get started with online safety. Built-in operating system controls, kid-safe browsers, and DNS filters like OpenDNS FamilyShield all offer valuable protection without any cost.

However, it's important to recognize the limitations of these tools. They may not have as many features or customization options as paid programs, and tech-savvy kids may find ways to circumvent them.

The key is to use these tools as part of a comprehensive approach to digital parenting. Combine them with regular conversations, clear family rules, and a willingness to adapt as your children grow and technology evolves.

In the next chapter, we'll explore some of the best paid parental control software on the market, and how they can provide even more robust protection for your family.
